task 1.

Coming into a new environment I'll firstly need to get situated with where I'm, And try to understand how things work around here. Since I was given a task of learning Go and Dart which I'm new too, I'll need to start planning how to work my techniques on how to accomplish the given tasks.

As a person who usaully have some problem with procrastination I'll need to start setting a study technique like pomodoro. Which will enable me to have 20 minutes of focusing on the material that I'm learning, and 5 minutes of break time.
